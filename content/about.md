Hi, I'm Ettore Ciarcia. I'm from Italy :it:

Currently working as Cloud Engineer @ [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io/)

This is a personal blog to share about stuff I learn, which also serves as a portfolio.
You can checkout [Archive](/archives) page to get a list of posts or can use [Tags](/tags) to find pages about specific keywords.

Here I keep a list of [events](/events) organized by the various communities I participate in, maybe we can catch up there!

Few interesting pages:

- [History of my career](/history-of-my-career)

- [Note for recruiters](/note-for-recruiters/)
