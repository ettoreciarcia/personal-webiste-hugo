## **0 Updates on homelab journey**


As you may have read in my previous article, I was looking for someone to keep me company on this very long journey.
And guess what? I found someone!
After talking to about twenty people on Reddit and scheduling a few calls, I finally set up the team.

The project officially started on May 9th at 18:10, with this email

>Hello and welcome everyone! Our journey has finally begun.
>You should have access to two Google Docs
>- HERE the guidelines and the code of conduct
>- HERE will put to a vote the messaging platforms that we will use to communicate. Our conversations will continue on the >platform we choose in this document
>You are all editors, you can modify and propose new ideas, I will be happy to discuss them with you.
>This is just a draft, I am not the owner of this project. We would have an equal relationship throughout the duration of >the trip.
>See you on the other side :)


We are spread over 4 different timezones ranging from the east of the USA to Australia, the collaboration mode will therefore be asynchronous.
