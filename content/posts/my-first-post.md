### Here we go, again.

Here I am making a list of good resolutions for 2023.


Wait, let's take a step back. First let's try to do a retrospective of my 2022 and the goals I set for myself.

Wait wait, let's take another step back, let's go back to the situation I was in when I set those goals.


A year ago I was about to finish my studies at the cyberhackdemy, a cybersecurity academy I was selected for in May 2021. Such a great time those months!
I was almost quitting the IT world after my very bad experience at Evil Corp (Maybe I'll look into this topic in the future), then came the CyberHackademy.
There I rediscovered the pleasure of sitting in front of a terminal looking at the shell. I had amazing mentors and met really good people-

The partner company of the cyberhackademy had offered me a contract, good money. I declined them.
You must be wondering why I turned down that money.
Because after leaving Evil Corp I received continuous contacts from recruiters on Linkedin for **that type** of consultancy.
When I left Evil Corp I promised myself that I would never get into a situation like this again in my life.  
And those offerings reeked of Evil Corp, but with more money. And it's about money.

So a little over a year ago, I was worried about my job situation. Let me explain: I have no problem finding a job in IT (in 2022 I received more than 130 messages from recruiters on Linkedin), my fear was of ending up in **that type** of consultancy again.

Then I met Epsilon, a life changer.

From day one I have worked with the technologies that interested me in a horizontal environment. No bosses, just people with more experience and more technically prepared.
In Epsilon I started making my first "professional" use of the Cloud and I went deeper into topics such as containerization technologies, Container orchestrators and Infrastructure as code policies.
I've made so many mistakes this past year, but I've learned so much.

### But what were the goals I set for myself at the end of 2021?

- [x] **Working at Epsilon**

I did it! 12/12 :)

- [x] **Regular workouts**

I did it all year until I injured my shoulder. No workouts for me in the last 2 months! :'(

- [ ] **AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification**

I made the mistake of not scheduling my exam date, so I practiced some mock exams but didn't book the exam. :(

- [x] **Open a blog**

I have partially achieved this goal. I wrote articles on various platforms, but I didn't publish them all.
The year isn't over yet and I'm writing on this blog. Can I consider it a success? :)

- [x] **Getting to the finish line of the cyberhackademy**

I did it! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDVL2ZiZcyg) you can find my presentation. I was terrified of going on stage, now I would gladly do it again :D

- [x] **Spend less time locked up in my cave**

I made two trips this year! Short trips, but still travel!
A summer holiday by the sea and I spent four days at Lucca Comics!
In addition to this, I spent about eighty days in Naples, sleeping there for 40 nights. :D

- [ ] **Get my degree in Computer Science**

Totally failed. I never tried an exam this year.
I never tried an exam this year. I just participated in an activity that took me 3 days to validate 3 credits. 
I'm still 21 credits away from my graduate degree, out of 180.
So I achieved a 3/24, with an overall of 159/180 for my degree

### And what will be my goals for this 2023?

- **I want to continue working on the technologies that interest me, trying to go deeper and deeper**

I would like to learn Go, write my first Kubernetes operator and improve my IaaC and pipeline skills

- **I want improve my English**

The goal for the end of the year is to understand and be understood by others when you talk about non-technical topics

- **I want workout regularly**

This goal is the same, I hope I don't get injured this year

- **I want take some certifications**

The plan is to take AWS Devops Professional and the CKA. If there is time left I would also like to take some Hashicorp certifications (Terraform maybe)

- **I want to go back on stage**

I would like to participate in some face-to-face event as a speaker talking about Kubernetes or Terraform

- **I want to publish at least one article a month on this blog**

I would talk about the topics that interest me, they don't necessarily have to be technical articles

### Conclusions

I am now officially publicly committed.

And I'm ready to fail!
